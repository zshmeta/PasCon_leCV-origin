### This is a JS remake of the previous cv builder made in React

#### ..by zshmeta

// after creating the first CV builder in Ract i have been asked to present it to the class so idecided to do a js version so everyone can understand it

1. What is it

2. Why i made it

3. What is the use

4. Coding process

5. Conclusion

## What Is It?

This is a remake of the previous React app of the same name. Tools are pretty much the same although it can be a little more complicated to set the server so i might just do an unsecure version . i will come back to edit

## Why I Made it

Since none of us has seen React yet and that i had to present it to all i decided to rewrite it in JS

## What is the use

Well for me it helped get more acquainted with building a light and safe back end to be able to use the API key that has to be secured
Also the excercise itself was a good checkpoint to see if i could concretise my idea in JS like i did in React
Beside that as is, it is probably not suited for production.
